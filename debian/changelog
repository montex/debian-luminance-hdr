qtpfsgui (1.8.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move maintenance to pkg-phototools now that the team has been created on
    alioth: Maintainer set to the team, put myself in Uploaders.
  * Update Vcs-* accordingly.
  * Add a “lrelease-qt4” call in the “makebuilddir” target, so that
    localization files get built, and then later installed. No longer
    “rmdir” the /usr/share/qtpfsgui since it is no longer empty.
