qtpfsgui (1.9.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Replace “COPYING” with “LICENSE” in the NOT_NEEDED variable of
    debian/rules, following upstream's renaming.
  * Update debian/links accordingly.
  * Delete the matching TODO item since there's no longer needed to have a
    patched (with HTML tags) license file to get a correct display in the
    “License agreement” tab.
  * Update the gcc4.3 patch (drop the hunk touching src/Libpfs/pfs.cpp):
     - 20_gcc4.3_includes.
  * Add a link from /usr/share/qtpfsgui/html to the HTML documentation
    under /usr/share/doc/qtpfsgui/html since the former is used at runtime
    to display the manual.

qtpfsgui (1.8.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move maintenance to pkg-phototools now that the team has been created
    on alioth: Maintainer set to the team, put myself in Uploaders.
  * Update Vcs-* accordingly.
  * Add a “lrelease-qt4” call in the “makebuilddir” target, so that
    localization files get built, and then later installed. Delete the
    generated files in the “clean” target. Use a stamp file to avoid
    double-run.
  * No longer “rmdir” the /usr/share/qtpfsgui directory since it is no
    longer empty.
  * Add a link (through debian/links) from /usr/share/qtpfsgui/COPYING to
    GPL-2 in common-licenses, since it is used in the “License agreement”
    tab. Add a TODO item accordingly (upstream uses HTML <pre> tags to
    format it).
  * Add patch to fix FTBFS with gcc 4.3 snapshots:
     - 20_gcc4.3_includes.
  * Add a minimal manpage generated from debian/qtpfsgui.pod using
    pod2man.
